# Lab 6 - Build your own SDN App (BYO-SDN-App)
Note: the python code in this lab has a dependency on the python-arango module. The module has been preinstalled on both the Rome and Amsterdam VMs, however, if one wishes to recreate this lab in their own environment any client node will need to install the module:
```
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip install python-arango 
```
Please proceed to [lab_6-Rome.md](https://github.com/jalapeno/SRv6_dCloud_Lab/blob/main/lab_6/lab_6-Rome.md)
