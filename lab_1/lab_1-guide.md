# SRv6 Lab 1 Guide

### Description: 
In Lab 1 the user will validate that the supplied topology is up and running and that all baseline connectivity 
is working. Second, they will validate that the pre-configured ISIS and BGP routing protocols are running and 
seeing the correct topology. Third, there will be lite SR-MPLS configuration on routers 1-7 and 
confirm PE 
and P roles. Last you will create basic SRv6 configuration on routers 1-7 and confirm connectivity.
