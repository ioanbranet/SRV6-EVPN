### Project Jalape√±o

Project Jalapeno combines existing open source tools with some new stuff we've developed into a data collection and warehousing infrastructure intended to enable development of SDN or network service applications. Think of it as applying microservices architecture and concepts to SDN: give developers the ability to quickly and easily build microservice control planes on top of a common data collection and warehousing infrastructure. More information on Jalapeno can be found at the Jalapeno Git repository: [LINK](https://github.com/cisco-open/jalapeno/blob/main/README.md)
